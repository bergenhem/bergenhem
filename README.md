# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Carl!

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlbergenhem/)

I am a Sales Engineer and Product Manager with a focus on technical products focusing on software development teams. I thrive at the intersection of technical software engineering topics and with the human side. I do not sell products, I uncover what my customers are struggling with and work diligently to find solutions for them - sales come as a natural side-effect.

## Previous experience:
Most recently I worked at Salto.io where I helped business application teams (think Salesforce, Netsuite, Zendesk, etc.) take advantage of change management processes that software engineers have perfected with their GitOps and CI/CD toolsets - all done within an intuitive user experience in a SaaS application. My work at Salto involved showing teams the benefits of having a process for adding or removing features from production (traditionally done directly in live environments), having a staging environment to test and easily push changes to prod, and how to build a structured approval process and change management workflow via git.

Proir to Salto I worked closely with software engineering teams to plan, rollout, and successfully implement a metrics program through the use of DORA metrics at Sleuth. With the Sleuth SaaS platform we integrated directly with git repos (GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps, and Bitbucket) and the CI/CD tool of choice (GitHub Actions, GitLab Pipelines, Azure DevOps Pipelines, Bitbucket Pipelines, CircleCI, and Buildkite) I was able to provide DORA metrics (Frequency, Change Lead Time, Failure Rate, and Meantime to Recovery or MTTR) to any engineering organization. From there I 

Working with Sleuth customers often involved diving deep into git histories to uncover why certain commits or PRs were a part of a deployment, and also debugging CI/CD pipelines to get to the bottom of why Sleuth collected metrics the way that it did (or, in some cases, did not collect any metrics). Through this process I would educate engineering teams of the merits of trunk-based development and how to streamline or improve their CI/CD processes.

In the past I led Sales Engineering and later Product for various UI component libraries at Telerik and Kendo UI, where I focused on web technologies and frameworks like:

- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- jQuery
- Angular
- React
- Vue
- Node.js

## Fun facts about me:
âš¡ Serial hobbyist - I love to learn new things and end up having too many hobbies to count
âš¡ Fitness enthusiast - I'm always down to try out any new sport or physical activity
âš¡ Metalhead - Whether it is old school heavy metal or some of the more obscure stuff I'm constatly on the search for my next favorite band
âš¡ Video game aficionado - I've been an avid gamer my whole life

## About my GitHub projects
My projects on GitHub are eclectic and not always up-to-date. They represent various stages of my career and sample applications I worked on to either gain knowledge about a particular technology, or sample projects I used to present features and functionality of the products that I supported.
